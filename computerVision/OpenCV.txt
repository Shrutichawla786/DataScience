Import OpenCV: Begin by importing the OpenCV library using import cv2.

Open Video Capture:

Create a video capture object using cv2.VideoCapture(0). Here, 0 indicates the default video capture device, which is usually your webcam.
Open Camera Check:

Use an if statement to check if the camera opened successfully using cap.isOpened(). If it doesn't open, print an error message and exit the program.
Video Capture Loop:

Employ a while True loop to continuously capture and display frames from the camera.
Capture Frame:

Inside the loop, use ret, frame = cap.read() to capture a frame from the camera. ret is a boolean flag indicating if the frame was read successfully, and frame is the captured image data.
Display Frame:

If the frame is read correctly (ret is True), use cv2.imshow('Camera', frame) to display the captured frame in a window named "Camera".
Quit on 'q' press:

Use cv2.waitKey(1) to wait for a key press for 1 millisecond. If the key pressed is 'q', break out of the loop using break. This allows you to quit the program by pressing the 'q' key.
Error Handling:

If ret is False (frame not read), print an error message and break out of the loop.
Release Camera and Close Windows:

After the loop exits, release the video capture object using cap.release() to free up resources.
Close all windows created by OpenCV using cv2.destroyAllWindows().
This code snippet demonstrates a basic setup for capturing video from your webcam using OpenCV in Python. You can extend this code to perform further image processing or computer vision tasks on the captured frames.
